                    This roller coaster simulation was coded in C++ as a project for a C++ for Engineers course. 
                    My job was to model the kinematics of a roller coaster within code and make a user interface to 
                    'create a useful tool to represent this model. Most of this project used object-oriented programming 
                    by treating each element in the simulation as its own class. Below is a demonstration of all its 
                    features and capabilities.

                    Below are some pictures of the subsystems of the boat. On the top right are the two motors which 
                    operated the boat as a skid steer. These were controlled by ESCs, operated by an Arduino with 
                    an IMU and a magnetometer to detect pose. On the bottom right was our sensor package, which 
                    included an Arduino wired to various water data sensors like salinity, turbidity, temperature, 
                    and pH. Lastly, on the bottom left, you can see the reel and chute system for deploying the 
                    sensor package and some of the internal electronics, like the batteries for powering all subsystems.
