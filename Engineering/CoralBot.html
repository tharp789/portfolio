                    CoralBot is an autonomous coral reef surveying robot that takes reef health metrics 
                    such as water data and specific species populations for scientists to predict reef decay better. 
                    This was done for e year-long Robotics Capstone, and the video below served as our final demo. 
                    It demonstrates our final functionality of the boat moving out to locations, deploying our 
                    sensor package into the water at specified depths, and outputting these readings to an off-board computer.

                    Below are some pictures of the subsystems of the boat. On the top right are the two motors which 
                    operated the boat as a skid steer. These were controlled by ESCs, operated by an Arduino with 
                    an IMU and a magnetometer to detect pose. On the bottom right was our sensor package, which 
                    included an Arduino wired to various water data sensors like salinity, turbidity, temperature, 
                    and pH. Lastly, on the bottom left, you can see the reel and chute system for deploying the 
                    sensor package and some of the internal electronics, like the batteries for powering all subsystems.
