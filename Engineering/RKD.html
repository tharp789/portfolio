                <text class="bodyText" class="textFormat">
                    This project was coded for a class called Robot Kinematics and Dynamics, where the aim of the project was to stack a 
                    certain amount of Jenga block layers within a time frame and the physical bounds of a tight box. Using inverse kinematics, 
                    we calculated the joint positions based on the desired end effector pose and commanded the robot to move to this position. 
                    Additionally, with inverse kinematic trajectory planning, we were able tos make straight-line movements in the world 
                    coordinate space with intermediate waypoints to achieve the final movement pattern. Below is a full demonstration of the 
                    final state of the project.

                    Below are some pictures of the subsystems of the boat. On the top right are the two motors which 
                    operated the boat as a skid steer. These were controlled by ESCs, operated by an Arduino with 
                    an IMU and a magnetometer to detect pose. On the bottom right was our sensor package, which 
                    included an Arduino wired to various water data sensors like salinity, turbidity, temperature, 
                    and pH. Lastly, on the bottom left, you can see the reel and chute system for deploying the 
                    sensor package and some of the internal electronics, like the batteries for powering all subsystems.
