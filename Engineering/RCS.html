                    This roller coaster simulation was coded in C++ as a project for a C++ for Engineers course. 
                    My job was to model the kinematics of a roller coaster within code and make a user interface to 
                    'create a useful tool to represent this model. Most of this project used object-oriented programming 
                    by treating each element in the simulation as its own class. Below is a demonstration of all its 
                    features and capabilities.
