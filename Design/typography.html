                This roller coaster simulation was coded in C++ as a project for a C++ for Engineers course.
                My job was to model the kinematics of a roller coaster within code and make a user interface to
                'create a useful tool to represent this model. Most of this project used object-oriented programming
                by treating each element in the simulation as its own class. Below is a demonstration of all its
                features and capabilities.
