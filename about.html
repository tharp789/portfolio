                    My name is Tyler Harp and I am currently pursuing a Masters in Mechanical Engineer with a concentration in Robotic and Control Systems from Carnegie Mellon.
                    My undergrad was also at Carnegie Mellon where I studied many topics like Engineering, Mechatronics, Robotics, and Design. Through my unique and multi-disciplinary
                    background, I hope to enter industry to help create complex and ground breaking robotic systems that seek to enable humans, rather than replace them.
